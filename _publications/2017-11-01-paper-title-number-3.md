In this paper, we present BIDE, an efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed sequences without candidate maintenance. It adopts a novel sequence closure checking scheme called BI-Directional Extension and prunes the search space more deeply compared to the previous algorithms by using the Back Scan pruning method.
